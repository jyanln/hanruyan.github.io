Currently, the field of REST API testing and verification is growing at an incredible rate, leading to the creation of a variety of tools with unique measurement metrics and benchmarked against various RESTful services. However, reproducing the result in REST API studies is particularly challenging, due to reasons such as changes in online service formats, oudated API specifications, and different API authentication and usage policies.

In this project, we create a set of benchmarks for REST API testing tools. We aim to include the most insightful metrics that can help both researchers and developers compare the differences of various testing approachs, and can work on both open-source and closed-source services.
